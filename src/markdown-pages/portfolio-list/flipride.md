aboutProgram: FlipRide was founded on the idea that there had to be a better way
  to connect dealers with interested and committed sellers and buyers. In a
  market where inventory matters, access to high-quality vehicles is critical,
  and it helps users drive their business by finding the right vehicles for

    portfolioSectionTitle: The challenge
    portfolioSectionText:
      There has never been more competition in auto sales than
      there is now. Much of that competition is coming from online. FlipRide
      Dealer Management Platform provides an end-to-end solution for car
      dealerships of all sizes.
  - portfolioSectionText: "For Flipride we’ve come up with a complex and
      multi-functional platform as a solution offering the best experience with
      activities like building and maintaining websites, tracking the customer
      flow, analysing lead data and keeping track of the inventory allowing an
      advanced level of synchronization. "

  - portfolioSectionText: The FlipRide Website Builder offers key dealership
      features designed to increase lead acquisition. Easy to use, quick to set
      up, and customized to the needs of car dealers. All the complex functions
      available at the users’ fingertips.

  - portfolioSectionText: Flipride helped car dealers  to have an easy-to-use
      website optimized for car dealerships, easily manage their inventory, and
      secured digital retailing to deepen shopper engagement with every click.
      In addition, Flipride solved the problem of low-quality, unresponsive
      prospective sellers that have no intention of doing business. Using its
      proprietary system, the platform finds real-time shoppers who are actively
      looking to sell. Thus the FlipRide app delivers the inventory to dealers
      in just a few clicks, giving them an edge over the competition.
