    portfolioSectionTitle: The challenge
    portfolioSectionText: Modern rental practices are often accompanied by problems
      such as unauthorized pets, fraudulent Emotional Support Animal (ESA)
      letters, poor pet waste-management practices, as well as pet damage costs.
      OurPetPolicy eliminates those problems and makes pet management a
      hassle-free and easy process for everyone.
  - portfolioSectionTitle: The solution
    portfolioSectionText: We developed a versatile and easy-to-use platform for
      managing all the pet-related processes without any headache. OurPetPolicy
      allows both landlords and tenants to keep track of their property and pet
      related activities and to easily handle issues that arise when renting
      with pets. The platform allows tenants to register pets, keep track of
      their medical records and handle issues like waste management and damage
      with a single click.
