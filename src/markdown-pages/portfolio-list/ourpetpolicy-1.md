      The OPP Platform is easy to implement, with easy to use on-boarding tools
      and platform management tools.

      When a tenant leaves and the damage from their pet is assessed to be hundreds of dollars more than their security deposit, most landlords understand that it is not worth taking them to court, where they could end up spending more money than they would recoup. By collecting pet deposits the landlords have more money to help cover the damage left by their animals.
  - portfolioSectionText: 'With the help of OPP the landlords have managed to
      dramatically decrease their costs and money wasted on pet damage and
      secured a more convenient and stress free way of handling all the
      rent-related tasks. '
