    portfolioSectionTitle: The challenge
    portfolioSectionText: We often hear of recreational vehicle owners whose
      vehicles sit unused for weeks at a time, with monthly payments, storage,
      and slowly deteriorating vehicle conditions. On the other hand, there are
      people who are always in need of an extra ATV for a trip. Or renters who
      want to rent a boat or snowmobile, and either can’t find one, the vehicle
      is too far from where they live, or it is too expensive. The DayTrail team
      came together to solve these problems with an easy-to-use platform that
      matches the right owners with the right renters.
  - portfolioSectionText: We developed a platform where owners can list quality
      recreational vehicles online, and renters browse for the perfect
      recreational vehicle for their next outdoor adventure. Renters select the
      location, vehicle preference, and date to find the perfect fit. In
      addition, renters can book the vehicle in a secure encrypted environment.
      DayTrail sends users the information they need to get ready for their
      vehicle pick-up.
