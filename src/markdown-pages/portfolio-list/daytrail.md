    portfolioSectionTitle: The challenge
    portfolioSectionText:
      ' While talking with friends and family people are often
      hearing of recreational vehicle owners whose vehicles sat unused for weeks
      at a time, with monthly payments, storage, and all the negatives that come
      along with having a vehicle sit unused. On the other hand, everyone has
      friends and family who are always in need of an extra ATV for a trip or
      want to rent a boat or snowmobile, and either can’t find one, the vehicle
      is too far from where they live or it is too expensive.  With some of the
      underlying concerns resolved, the DayTrail team came together to create an
      easy-to-use platform that matches the right owners with the right
      renters.'
  - portfolioSectionText:
      We’ve developed a platform with the help of which owners
      list quality recreational vehicles online, and renters browse for the
      perfect recreational vehicle for their next outdoor adventure. They just
      select the location, vehicle preference, and date to find the perfect fit.
      In addition, they book the vehicle in a secure encrypted environment.
      DayTrail sends the users all of the information they need to get ready for
      their vehicle pick-up.
